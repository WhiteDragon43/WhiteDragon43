- 👋 Hi, I’m @WhiteDragon43, weeks short of Octogenarian status happily retired. Worked with ComputerVision's CAD/CAM for several years and a few contracting in the 90s 
- 👀 I’m interested in Tcl/Tk scripts which was brilliant interfacing into CAD/CAM, wish I had Lua and now LuaJit, smokey!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bulgarian as considering emigrating - also Zshell in conjunction with Pro Vim - an all in IDE capability. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 'not much' doubt if I qualify as not expert enough in anything.
- 📫 How to reach me 'not nw, later'...
